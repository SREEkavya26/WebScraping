Thanks to all new A14 Bionic chip.<br/>Build quality was great as always from Apple.<br/>Phone feels light on hands due to aluminium body. I chose Blue colour because wanted to go for different colour than routine Black and white iPhones so initially I was bit skeptical but after seeing the phone in person I’m happy with the blue colour  “ not bad at all and not too flashy”<br/>Grip and feel perfect. Phone comes with iOS 14.1. Camera quality was excellent and sufficient  as a normal user.<br/>If you are from iOS ecosystem nothing will go wrong here.<br/>There is nothing to question about the quality and interface from Apple ( it’s my personal opinion as a long time apple user)<br/>As you all know iPhone 12 won’t comes with earphones and charging brick( adapter)<br/>I bought separately 20w apple adapter from new Apple India online store for Rs.1900<br/>I don’t judge here apple because of accessories removal and the price tag. I hope apple can justify this.<br/>I only hope and wanted to see so badly Made in India IPhones so that we all can enjoy lower priced ( at least a better priced) iPhones in the future.<br/>A big thanks to Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd and Amazon for delivering genuine iPhone as always in perfect condition. Delivered way before the promised date.<br/>Update: (01/12/2020) After testing 25 days especially on battery life of this iPhone 12, results were amazing and I’m completely satisfied  with the battery performance. On Moderate gaming, Moderate Video Content, heavy on calls and heavy on browsing this iPhone 12 battery life is sufficient for your regular Day.<br/>My conclusion is definitely a better and improved battery performer than the previous iPhone model.<br/>Thank you Apple India<br/>Thank you Appario Retail Pvt.

This phone is a joke in comparison with any Samsung flagship phone. I am shocked that so many fools like me are falling for apple’s trickery and gimmickry.<br/><br/>The battery doesn’t last half a day. Screen size is average. Thickness of this phone will constantly remind you that this phone belongs to another era. 64gb space won’t be enough for anyone.<br/><br/>And then there are other apple quirks - won’t come with a SD card, won’t come with a charging brick or a set of head phones. Your headphones with the regular audio pin won’t work with this one. Face ID won’t work with masks on. So your forced to remove your masks when you’re out and vulnerable. This phone won’t allow you set google maps as default. So you continue to suffer using their apple map which I bet even Tim Cook doesn’t use. You won’t be able to set google chrome as your default browser as iOS won’t let you.<br/><br/>Overall the phone is overpriced and overrated. Anybody with half the wit will figure that this phone is a joke and a mere marketing gimmick. An ordinary phone like this shouldn’t cost you more than 12 to 14K.<br/><br/>Apple is going down!<br/><br/>Amazon won’t take this phone back as they have a 10 day return policy.

But this to me doesnt seem fast charging for 2800~ mah battery.<br/><br/>I wont say that this phone is too poor. It gives us all that it promises. Personally I dont recommend investing 85k Indian money into this. Either go for lower versions of other iphones like 11 or you can wait for an year and buy this at cheaper cost.<br/><br/>PROS : Camera &amp; Perfomance<br/>CONS : Battery and Cost\n",

But not really convinced if this is all we get for 84k?Fast charging - I bought a 20W charger from apple store for Rs.1900. I plug in when the battery is 20-25% and it takes 1.45 hours to reach 100%. If this is all about fast charging you are looking for, well and good. I never tried with magsafe, honestly. But this to me doesnt seem fast charging for 2800~ mah battery.I wont say that this phone is too poor. It gives us all that it promises. Personally I dont recommend investing 85k Indian money into this. Either go for lower versions of other iphones like 11 or you can wait for an year and buy this at cheaper cost.PROS : Camera & PerfomanceCONS : Battery and Cost',\n",
              " 'I am writing this review after 40 days of use of iPhone 12. phone camera is excellent like DSLR ,very fast processor ,face ID feature looks great ,overall everything is fine but only issue which this phone has is , battery draining too fast. You can use 100% battery only for 5-6 hours of continuous use after that you have to charge it. Apple should look into this.']"
